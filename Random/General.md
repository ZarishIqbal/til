### What is declarative code and imperative code?

Declarative programming is a paradigm describing WHAT the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow. Imperative programming is a paradigm describing HOW the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program's state.

### What are webhooks and polling?
Webhooks are automated messages sent from apps when something happens.They have a message—or payload—and are sent to a unique URL—essentially the app's phone number or address. Webhooks are almost always faster than polling, and require less work on your end.
#### Analogy 
>Polling is like knocking on your friend’s door and asking if they have any sugar (aka information), but you have to go and ask for it every time you want it. Webhooks are like someone tossing a bag of sugar at your house whenever they buy some. You don't have to ask, they just automatically punt it over every time it's available.
