### What is declarative code and imperative code?

Declarative programming is a paradigm describing WHAT the program does, without explicitly specifying its control flow. Imperative programming is a paradigm describing HOW the program should do something by explicitly specifying each instruction (or statement) step by step, which mutate the program's state.
